# Soft Dorothy Software Projects
Disk images (intended for emulators) containing code and tools for building Soft Dorothy Software games.

My desire was to recover the sources to my old Soft Dorothy Software games as well as the old build environment (THINK C, THINK Pascal, ResEdit) and create disk images suitable for the current early Macintosh emulators. The disk images here (zipped to save space) can be downloaded and you should be able to mount them in <a href="https://basilisk.cebix.net">Basilisk II</a>, <a href="https://sheepshaver.cebix.net">Sheepshaver</a> or <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">MiniVMac</a>. 

### GlyphaII.dsk

The project, sources and resource file for Glypha II. THINK Pascal and ResEdit are included on the disk image as well. As with the other files, GlyphaII.dsk needs to be unzipped and then mounted with one of the early Mac emulators listed above.

Most of the files indicate a date of around May or June 1991. The fall of 1991 was when I believe I released the first commercial game, Glider 4.0, via Casady & Greene Inc. (C&G). C&G wanted a color game (of course) but I had only a B&W Macintosh Plus up until this point. They gave me an advance against future royalties that I used to buy a IIsi color Macintosh computer and a color display.

Even though I now had color computer I was still new to color programming. It seemed crazy to me that my first forray into color would also be my first commercial game. So in fact I took my shareware game, Glypha, and decided to port that to color before ever beginning on the commerical Glider. The rationale of course was that I could cut my teeth on a free app, "ship it" (post it to various FTP sites) and get feedback as to whether I was crashing anyone's computers while I began what would be Glider 4.0 for C&G.

The good news was that Glypha II ran fine — as did Glider 4.0 when it shipped later that year. Something I did not know then was the degree to which C&G would test Glider 4.0 on all the hardware they had available before pressing thousands of floppy discs. I need not have ben as anxious as I was.
